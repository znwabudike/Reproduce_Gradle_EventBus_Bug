# Reproduce_Gradle_EventBus_Bug
This code sample reproduces a Gradle/EventBus error I found that effects only certain devices across a range of API levels. I have tested seen it on KitKat through MarshMallow, however I only have a Nexus 5X as a Nougat device and there is no issue there.   

One example is two devices with similar hardware but different results is the Samsung Galaxy S5(AT&T) vs Samsung Galaxy S5(Verizon).
